# TotalRecall [![build status](https://gitlab.com/eval/total_recall/badges/master/build.svg)](https://gitlab.com/eval/total_recall/commits/master)

Turn **any** csv-file into a [Ledger](http://ledger-cli.org/) journal.

## Introduction

`total_recall` assumes nothing about the structure of your csv, nor of the ledger-file you want to create.  
Instead, one creates a yaml-config consisting of:
* a [mustache-template](https://github.com/defunkt/mustache) of the ledger-file
* the source (and parse-options) of the csv
* the value of every template-variable via Ruby lambdas

## Example

After installation you run `total_recall init bank` to generate the following file:
```
# file: bank.yml
:total_recall:
  :version: 0.6.0
:template:
  :raw: |-
    ; -*- ledger -*-Â¬

    {{# transactions}}
    {{date}} {{{description}}}
      {{to}}    EUR {{amount}}
      {{from}}

    {{/ transactions}}

:csv:
  #:file: total_recall.csv
  :raw: |-
    "2013-11-01","Foo","2013-11-02","1.638,00"
    "2013-11-02","Bar","2013-11-03","-492,93"
  :options:
    #:col_sep: ";"
    #:headers: false

:context:
  :transactions:
    :__defaults__:
      :from: !!proc |
        ask_account("What account provides these transactions?", default: 'Assets:Checking')
    :date: !!proc row[0]
    :description: !!proc row[1]
    :amount: !!proc row[3]
    :to: !!proc |
      render_row(columns: [0, 1, 3])
      ask_account("To what account did the money go?")
```

The `template`-section is pretty straightforward: you can add any variable you need using the [mustache-syntax](http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html).  
The `csv`-section defines where csv comes from and what parse-options should be used. It's best to start with a csv-snippet in `raw` (and leave `file` commented) in order to test-run the config.

In the `context`-section the actual mapping is done: in this section your should define a key for every variable in the template.  
A key's value is derived from the csv via Ruby. This can be done via a simple mapping: `:date: !!proc row[0]`, via some specific operation: `:data: !!proc Date.parse(row[0]).iso8601` or via one of the [interactive helpers](https://gitlab.com/eval/total_recall/blob/v0.6.0/lib/total_recall.rb#L27-50) as you can see for the `to`-field above.  
Fields can also have default-values: the `from`-field for example is the same for all rows.

As it's all Ruby, you can make the mapping as smart as you like:
```
:context:
  :transactions:
    :description: !!proc row[3]
    :to: !!proc |
      guess = begin
        case self.description # the description-field is defined above
        when /CREDITCARD/ then "Liabilities:MasterCard"
        when /INTERNET/i then "Expenses:Communication"
        end
      end
      ask_account("To what account did the money go?", default: guess)
...
```

See [Extensibility](#extensibility) below for providing your own Ruby module with helpers (i.e. your own self-learning account-guesser!).

Once your config is done, you can give it a spin:
```bash
# the result will be echoed:
$ total_recall ledger -c bank.yml

# to quickly see if the output is actually valid ledger:
$ total_recall ledger -c bank.yml | ledger -f - reg
```

When the output looks good and doesn't make Ledger choke, you can uncomment the file-key in the csv-section and run it against the real csv-data:
```bash
$ total_recall ledger -c bank.yml > bank.dat
```

That's it!

To see an extensive annotated config-file do:
```bash
$ total_recall sample
```

## Install

```bash
gem install total_recall
```

## Usage

```bash
total_recall

# Commands:
#   total_recall help [COMMAND]              # Describe available commands or one specific command
#   total_recall init NAME                   # Generate a minimal config NAME.yml
#   total_recall ledger -c, --config=CONFIG  # Convert CONFIG to a ledger
#   total_recall sample                      # Generate an annotated config
#   total_recall version                     # Show total_recall version

# typically you would do:
total_recall init my-bank

# fiddle with the settings in 'my-bank.yml' and test-run it:
total_recal ledger -c my-bank.yml
# to skip prompts just provide dummy-data:
yes 'Dummy' | total_recal ledger -c my-bank.yml

# export it to a journal:
total_recall ledger -c my-bank.yml > my-bank.dat

# verify correctness with ledger:
ledger -f my-bank.dat bal
```

## Extensibility

You can extend the ledger subcommand by passing a file with additions to it:

```
total_recall ledger -c my-bank.yml -r ./my_extension.rb
```

This makes it possible to add helpers or redefine existing ones:

```ruby
cat my_extension.rb
module MyExtension
  # adding some options to an existing helper:
  def ask_account(question, options = {})
    question.upcase! if options.delete(:scream)
    super
  end

  # a new helper:
  def guess_account(question, options = {})
    guess = Guesser.new.guess
    ask_account(question, default: guess)
  end
end

TotalRecall::SessionHelper.include MyExtension
```

## Develop
    
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/eval/total_recall.git
cd total_recall
bundle
bundle exec rake spec
```
